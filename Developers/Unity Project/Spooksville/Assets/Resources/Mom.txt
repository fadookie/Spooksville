You're not my son, dumb kid/
You have failed child, and now your halloween year shall end/
Come Son, this is your end, your hell/
Do you know what happened to Dad? I ate him along with all of last year's candy!/
S0ck my $%^#/
As I thought, you're nothing but a disappointment. If you're going to attack someone, don't hold back!/
I'm so glad that you were adopted and not my actual child. Oops! Did I say that out loud? *evil laughter*
